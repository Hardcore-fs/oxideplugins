**Permissions**

This plugin uses Oxide's permission system. To assign a permission, use **grant user <username|steamid> <permission>**. To remove a permission, use **revoke user <username|steamid> <permission>**.


* ****entityowner.**canchangeowners **(allow auth and own commands)
**Ex.** grant user Calytic entityowner.canchangeowners 
**Ex.** revoke user Calytic entityowner.canchangeowners 
**Ex.** grant group moderator entityowner.canchangeowners
* ****entityowner.**cancheckowners **(allow prod command)
**Ex.** grant user Calytic entityowner.cancheckowners 
**Ex.** revoke user Calytic entityowner.cancheckowners 
**Ex.** grant group moderator entityowner.cancheckowners 


**Configuration Options**


* 
**EntityLimit **(default: 8000)

There is a hard cap on how many entities may be included in any given ownership command.  By default, this cap is 8000.


* 
**messages **(Localization)

It is possible to change most of the messages sent by EntityOwner into a different language.


* 
**DistanceThreshold **(default: 3)

It is suggested to ratchet the threshold down by 1 tenth each time (2.9, 2.8, 2.7 ..) until you are satisfied with the level of precision when using commands like /own and /prod2.


The DistanceThreshold option allows you to configure how far the ownership commands will seek for other nearby entities (starting from the first entity). Changing the threshold will make ownership commands more or less precise.
